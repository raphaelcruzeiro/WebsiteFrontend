                    <p>I have a quite large set of tools to choose for each task:</p><p>The backend of my applications is usually coded in <em>Python</em> using the amazing <em>Django</em> web framework. This powerful combination enables me to deliver high quality software with considerably less development time than the alternatives.</p>
                    <p>My frontends are created using <em>yeoman</em> which generates me a really nice project structure with <em>Grunt</em> to automate tasks, and <em>Bower</em> for dependency management. The code itself is created using HTML5 ans CSS3 (through SASS) combined with the relativelly new <em>AngularJS Framework</em>. This powerful combination allows me to create an awesome, reliable and maintainable frontend guaranteening an amazing UX.</p>
                    <p>I have also been known for ocasinally surf the world of mobile development, creating apps for Android and iOS (and sometimes with the same codebase for both platforms using <em>Cordova</em> with <em>Steroids</em>).</p>
